title: 2019 AGM and New Website
---
It has been a long time since we have had a club update on the website.  So without further
delay it gives me great pleasure to give the first update of the 2019 season with 
a write up of our AGM held a few weeks ago and a general update as to the state of our 
online presence.

# 2019 AGM
This was held on Sunday 17th February 2019 at the Doddington Lodge Hotel in Whitchurch and
commenced at 19:44 and closed at 20:18.  Highlights from the AGM were:

* All officers (Chairman, Diving Officer, Treasurer, Secretary) to stand as last year.
* Planning a trip to Oban (Fall 2019)
* Planning a trip to St Abbs (Summer 2019)
* Annual club overseas expedition still TBC.

# New Website and social platforms
The club is currently undergoing a digital transformation project (who isn't these days!)
and the first phase of this is to have a website which can serve as the primary source of
club news and as a point of contact with the officers of the club and for potential new 
members to book try-dives.  As this post goes live the website is complete (barring a few photo updates)
and we are looking to move into "phase two" of the digital transformation which will include:

* Creation of a [facebook][facebook] page to allow members to communicate with each other
* Creation of a [youtube][youtube] channel to allow members to share their videos

Once phase two is complete, the third and final phase will be to build an access platform
allowing members to easily add posts to the main site (like this one) without having to have knowledge of 
IT toolchains such as Jekyll and Git.
